Algorithm Used:
- Optimized Best-Fit Greedy Scheduling
- Capacity-indexed room groups
- Min-Heap based room availability

Time Complexity:
- Parsing: O(N)
- Sorting Rooms: O(R log R)
- Sorting Meetings: O(M log M)
- Allocation: Target approximately O(M log R)

Space Complexity:
- O(R + M)

Implements the Best-Fit Greedy Scheduling Algorithm for the Meeting Room
Allocation System.

Scheduling workflow
-------------------
1. Sort rooms by capacity and group them into capacity-indexed buckets.
2. Sort meetings chronologically by precomputed start minute.
3. For each meeting, binary-search the smallest capacity bucket that can fit
   the attendee count (best-fit starts at the minimum sufficient capacity).
4. Within each bucket, use a min-heap keyed by (max_end, order_index) to
   quickly find rooms that are already idle before the meeting start; fall
   back to a deterministic order_index scan with O(log B) overlap checks when
   every room still has a booking ending after the meeting start.
5. If no suitable room is found, record the meeting as a conflict.

Why these data structures
-------------------------
- Capacity buckets + bisect_left: skip undersized rooms in O(log C) time,
  where C is the number of distinct capacities (C <= R).
- Per-room sorted booking lists: meetings are processed in nondecreasing start
  order, so appending keeps intervals sorted and enables O(log B) overlap checks
  via bisect on neighboring bookings only.
- Min-heap per capacity bucket: rooms with max_end <= meeting_start are provably
  free (all prior bookings ended), so the heap surfaces idle rooms in O(log R)
  time instead of scanning every peer in the bucket.
- order_index tie-breaking: preserves deterministic best-fit output when several
  rooms share the same capacity.
